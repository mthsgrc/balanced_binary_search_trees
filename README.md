ODIN PROJECT - Binary Search Tress

Project on binary search trees creating relative methods to manipulate the nodes of the tree.

The concepts were a little hard to get.

[Geekforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org) site was of great help for me explaining the the concepts and pseudocodes.

In the end, I possibly have to look into the matter a bit more to internialize it for real.
